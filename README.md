# Week2_challenge_moore

Developed a personal Portfolio:

The portfolio includes a nav abr that takes the user to and About Me section that describes the coder. It takes the user to a Wrok section that shows projects the developer has created. Also, it takes the user to a contacts section that shows way the coder can be reached. There is also a link to the coder's resume.
